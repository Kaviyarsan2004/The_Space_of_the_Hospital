  <h2>Production:</h2>
  <p>When director Benoît Pilon read Bernard Émond's screenplay, he wanted Inuit actor Natar Ungalaaq as the lead role after seeing him in the Inuit film Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner. Ungalaaq read the screenplay, and found the story personal as his real-life grandfather was diagnosed with tuberculosis during the historical epidemic in the 1950s. He did not disclose this story to the media until after the film was complete. For his role as Kaki, Paul-André Brasseur, who lived in Montreal and spoke French, learned his Inuktitut lines with Ungalaaq's aid.

    The budget was $4 million. Filming took place over nearly a year, in numerous locations. Arctic scenes were shot around Iqaluit, Nunavut, and other scenes were shot in Quebec City, Quebec.</p>

  <h2>Release and Reception:</h2>
  <p>The film premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival and at the Théâtre Maisonneuve on August 25, 2008. It opened in wider Quebec theaters on August 29 and was later re-released in Montreal, Quebec City, and Sherbrooke on April 3, 2009.

    After being submitted for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Entertainment One granted distribution rights for the United States to IFC Films in January 2009. Entertainment One subsequently re-released the film in Toronto, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009.</p>

  <h2>Critical Response:</h2>
  <p>The film received critical acclaim. "The Necessities of Life" has an approval rating of 60% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

    In Canada, Marc-André Lussier of La Presse called the film beautiful and praised Natar Ungalaaq's strong and charismatic performance. Brendan Kelly of The Montreal Gazette labeled it "quite simply one of the best Quebecois films of the year." Normand Provencher, also from La Presse, described it as intelligent and beautiful. Brian D. Johnson, writing for Maclean's, assessed the film as "an immaculately crafted, deeply distressing drama," though challenging to watch due to its subject matter. Johnson praised Ungalaaq's graceful performance but noted occasional depictions of the noble savage trope. Linda Barnard, in The Toronto Star, praised it as "A gentle yet moving story," highlighting Ungalaaq's performance.
    
    Following Quebec's Jutra Awards, MP Marcel Proulx remarked in the House of Commons of Canada in March 2009 that the film made a powerful statement on the distinct cultures of Nunavik and the rest of Quebec. MP Roger Pomerleau also publicly congratulated Ungalaaq.
    
    Writing for Variety, Dennis Harvey noted that "Necessities knows just how to eke maximum poignancy from its events without seeming to manipulate for tearjerking effect." Dan Kois, of The Washington Post, found the film "thoughtful and, especially at its end, quite touching," but criticized its lack of originality and bland direction. Cliff Doerksen, in The Chicago Reader, remarked that while parts of the film seemed no better than a TV movie, the acting remained understated and strong. </p>

  <h2>Accolades:</h2>
  <p>Among its accolades, "The Necessities of Life" received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and garnered multiple wins at the Genie Awards and Jutra Awards.</p>
